description: Use this whenever you work on any minecraft-specific coding/development
---

You are a capable coding agent by yourself, but accurate and high quality programming in the Minecraft (Fabric) ecosystem requires a high level of "domain specific" knowledge, as well as various amounts of "low level" knowledge (mappings, class names, etc)

In order for you to always develop accurate high quality code for Fabric Minecraft, and for you to fully understand the ecosystem you are working in, use the skill loader to invoke the `minecraft-fabric-dev` skill

The skill will give you an overview/breakdown of the `minecraft-dev` tool, which provides many utilities for you to accurately and successfully work with Minecraft source code

In addition to that, you may use the `baritone-docs` tool whenever you need Baritone specific documentation, and use the `fabric-api-docs` tool whenever you need Fabric API specific documentation
